                      Release of version 1.10 of Bleach
==============================================================================


NAME
    Bleach - For *really* clean programs

SYNOPSIS
            use Bleach;

            print "Hello world";

DESCRIPTION
    The first time you run a program under `use Bleach', the module removes
    all the unsightly printable characters from your source file. The code
    continues to work exactly as it did before, but now it looks like this:

            use Bleach;
                                                                                             
INSTALLATION

    It's all pure Perl, so just put the .pm file in its appropriate
    local Perl subdirectory.
